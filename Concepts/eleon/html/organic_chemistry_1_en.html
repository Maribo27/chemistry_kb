Valencies of carbon remaining free in the carbon skeleton are saturated with hydrogen or other atoms or groups called substituents. 
The most important for the organic chemistry of the substituent atoms are N (nitrogen), O (oxygen), S (sulfur), followed by halogens, boron, phosphorus and then with a 
large separation many other elements of the periodic table.
