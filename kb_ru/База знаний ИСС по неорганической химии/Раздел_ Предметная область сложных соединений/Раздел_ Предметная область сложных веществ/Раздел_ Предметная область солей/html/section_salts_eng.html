 <b><sc_element sys_idtf = "salt">Salts</sc_element></b> are complex substances that dissociate into metal cations and anions of acid residues in aqueous solutions. IUPAC defines salts as chemical compounds consisting of cations and anions. There is one more definition: salts are substances that can be obtained by the interaction of acids and bases with the release of water.<br>
If we consider salts as products of substitution of protons in acids or hydroxo groups in bases, the following types of salts can be distinguished:
<ul>
<li> <b><sc_element sys_idtf = "normal_salt">Normal salts</sc_element></b> are the products of substitution of all hydrogen cations in acid molecules for metal cations (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>).
<li> <b><sc_element sys_idtf = "acid_salt">Acidic salts</sc_element></b> are products of partial substitution of hydrogen cations in acids for metal cations (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>). They are formed when the base is neutralized with an excess of acid (i.e., under conditions of lack of base or excess of acid).
<li> <b><sc_element sys_idtf = "alkali_salt">Basic salts</sc_element></b> are the products of partial substitution of the hydroxyl groups of the base (OH-) with acid residues ((CuOH)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>). They are formed in conditions of excess of base or lack of acid.
</ul>
According to the number of cations and anions present in the structure, the following types of salts are distinguished:
<ul>
<li> <b><sc_element sys_idtf = "simple_salt">Simple salts</sc_element></b> - salts consisting of one kind of cations and one kind of anions (NaCl)
<li> <b><sc_element sys_idtf = "double_salt">Double salts</sc_element></b> are salts containing two different cations (KAl (SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>· 12 H<sub>2</sub>O).
<li> <b><sc_element sys_idtf = "mixed_salt">Mixed salts</sc_element></b> are salts that contain two different anions (Ca (OCl) Cl).
</ul>
Also distinguish <b>hydrate salts</b> (<sc_element sys_idtf = "crystalline_hydrate">crystalline hydrates</sc_element>), which include molecules of crystallization water, for example, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>· 10 H<sub>2</sub>O, and <b><sc_element sys_idtf = "complex_salt">complex salts</sc_element></b> containing a complex cation or complex anion (K< sub>4</sub>[Fe (CN)<sub>6</sub>], [Cu (NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>] (OH)<sub>2</sub>). <b><sc_element sys_idtf = "inner_salt">Internal salts</sc_element></b> are formed by bipolar ions, that is, molecules containing both a positively charged and a negatively charged atom.<br>
<H3>Physical properties and structure of salts</h3>
As a rule, salts are crystalline substances with an ionic crystal lattice. For example, crystals of alkali and alkaline earth metal halides (NaCl, CsCl, CaF<sub>2</sub>) are built from anions located on the principle of the closest ball packing and cations occupying voids in this package. Ionic salt crystals can also be constructed from acid residues combined into infinite anionic fragments and three-dimensional frameworks with cations in cavities (silicates). Such a structure is correspondingly reflected in their physical properties: they have high melting points, in a solid state are dielectrics.<br><br>
Also known are salts of a molecular (covalent) structure (for example, aluminum chloride AlCl<sub>3</sub>). In many salts, the nature of chemical bonds is intermediate between ionic and covalent.<br><br>
Of particular interest are ionic liquids - salts with a melting point below 100 ° C. In addition to the anomalous melting point, ionic liquids have practically zero saturated vapor pressure and high viscosity. The specific properties of these salts are explained by the low symmetry of the cation, the weak interaction between ions and a good cation charge distribution.<br><br>
An important property of salts is their solubility in water. This criterion distinguishes <b>soluble</b>, <b>little soluble</b> and <b>insoluble salts</b>.<br>
<H3>Chemical properties</h3>
The chemical properties are determined by the properties of the cations and anions that make up their composition.<br><br>
Salts react with acids and bases if the reaction results in a product that leaves the reaction sphere (sediment, gas, little-dissociating substances, for example, water):<br>
BaCl<sub>2</sub>+ H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>= BaSO<sub>4</sub>↓ + 2HCl<br>
NaHCO<sub>3</sub>+ HCl = NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub><br>
Na<sub>2</sub>SiO3 + 2HCl = 2NaCl + H2<sub>2</sub>SiO3 ↓<br><br>
Salts interact with metals if the free metal is to the left of the metal in the salt composition in the electrochemical series of metal activity:<br>
Cu + HgCl<sub>2</sub>= CuCl<sub>2</sub>+ Hg<br><br>
Salts interact with each other if the reaction product exits the reaction sphere (gas, precipitate or water forms); Including these reactions can occur with a change in the degrees of oxidation of the atoms of the reagents:<br>
CaCl<sub>2</sub>+ Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>= CaCO<sub>3</sub>↓ + 2NaCl<br>
AgNO<sub>3</sub>+ NaCl = AgCl ↓ + NaNO<sub>3</sub><br>
K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>+ 3Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>+ 4H<sub >2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>= Cr<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>+ 3Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>+ K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>+ 4H<sub>2</sub>O<br><br>
Some salts decompose on heating:<br>
CuCO<sub>3</sub>= CuO + CO<sub>2</sub><br>
Ca (NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>= Ca (NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>+ O<sub>2</sub ><br>
NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>= N<sub>2</sub>O + 2H<sub>2</sub>O<br>
NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>= N<sub>2</sub>+ 2H<sub>2</sub>O<br>
<H3>Finding in nature</h3>
Many minerals are salts that form deposits (for example, halite NaCl, silvin KCl, fluorite CaF<sub>2</sub>.<br>
<H3>Applying salts</h3>
Salts are widely used both in production and in everyday life.
<ul>
<li> <b><sc_element sys_idtf = "chloride">Hydrochloric acid salts</sc_element></b> . Of the chlorides most commonly used are sodium chloride and potassium chloride.
Sodium chloride (table salt) is isolated from lake and sea water, and also mined in salt mines. Table salt is used for food. In industry, sodium chloride serves as a raw material for the production of chlorine, sodium hydroxide and soda.
Potassium chloride is used in agriculture as a potash fertilizer.
<li> <b><sc_element sys_idtf = "sulfate">Sulfuric acid Salts</sc_element></b> . In construction and in medicine, the semi-aquatic gypsum obtained during roasting rock (calcium sulfate dihydrate) is widely used. When mixed with water, it cools rapidly, forming calcium sulfate dihydrate, that is, gypsum. Sodium sulfate decahydrate is used as a raw material for the production of soda.
<li> <b><sc_element sys_idtf = "nitrate">Nitric acid salts</sc_element></b> . Nitrates are most often used as fertilizers in agriculture. The most important of these are sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, calcium nitrate and ammonium nitrate. Usually these salts are called nitrates.
<li>Of the <b><sc_element sys_idtf = "phosphate">orthophosphates</sc_element></b> , the most important is calcium orthophosphate. This salt serves as the main constituent of minerals - phosphorites and apatites. Phosphorites and apatites are used as raw materials in the production of phosphate fertilizers, for example, superphosphate and precipitate.
<li> <b><sc_element sys_idtf = "carbonate">Carbonate salts</sc_element></b> . Calcium carbonate is used as a raw material for lime production. Sodium carbonate (soda) is used in the production of glass and in the cooking of soap.
