<b><sc_element sys_idtf  = "seismic_survey">Seismic survey</sc_element></b> -  is one form of geophysical survey that aims at measuring the earthâ€™s (geo-) properties by means of physical (-physics) principles such as magnetic,
electric, gravitational, thermal, and elastic theories.  It is based on the theory of elasticity and therefore tries to deduce elastic properties of materials by measuring their
response to elastic disturbances called seismic (or elastic) waves.
