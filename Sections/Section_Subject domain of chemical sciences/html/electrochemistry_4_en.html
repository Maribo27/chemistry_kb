The theoretical basis of electrochemistry is the theory of electrolytes, the theory of the double electric layer and the theory of the elementary act of electron transfer. 
Electrochemistry uses theoretical methods of mathematical and quantum chemistry, taking into account the specific behavior of systems containing charged particles and 
charged interfaces, the apparatus of theoretical electrodynamics and electrostatics, methods of statistical physics, chemical thermodynamics, and kinetics.
