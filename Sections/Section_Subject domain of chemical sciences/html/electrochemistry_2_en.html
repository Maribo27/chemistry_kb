The range of objects of research of electrochemistry includes:
<ul>
    <li>interfaces between different ionic systems, including those formed by ion systems and separating their membranes;</li>
    <li>interfaces between these ion systems and metals, semiconductors or dielectrics (electrode materials);</li>
    <li>materials (phases) of variable composition, the formation of which is induced by processes on charged interphase boundaries.</li>
</ul>
