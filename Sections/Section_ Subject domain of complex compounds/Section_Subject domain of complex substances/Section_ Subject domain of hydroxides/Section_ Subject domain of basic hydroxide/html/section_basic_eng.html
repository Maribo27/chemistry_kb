<b> The basic hydroxides </b> in the aqueous solution dissociate to form anions of OH- and cations.<br>
The name of the base usually consists of two words: the words "hydroxide" and the name of the metal in the genitive case.<br>
<h3> Getting </h3>
<ul>
<li> Interaction of strong basic oxide with water allows to obtain a strong base or alkali.<br>
CaO + H<sub>2</sub>O -> Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub><br>
<li> The base can also be obtained by reacting an alkaline or alkaline earth metal with water.<br>
Ca + 2H<sub>2</sub>O -> Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub><br>
<li> Alkali metal hydroxides in industry are obtained by electrolysis of aqueous solutions of salts:<br>
2NaCl + 2H<sub>2</sub>O -> 2NaOH + H<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub>
<li> Some reasons can be obtained by exchange reactions:<br>
Li <sub>2</sub>SO <sub>4</sub> + Ba (OH)<sub>2</sub> -> 2LiOH + BaSO<sub>4</sub>
</ul>
<br>
The foundations of metals occur naturally in the form of minerals, for example: hydrargillite Al (OH) <sub>3</sub>, brucite Mg (OH) <sub>2</sub>.

<h3> Chemical properties </h3>
<ul>
<li> In aqueous solutions the bases dissociate, which changes the ionic equilibrium.<br>
This change is manifested in the colors of some acid-base indicators:<br>
litmus becomes blue,<br>
methylorange - yellow,<br>
phenolphthalein is fuchsia.<br>
<li> When reacting with an acid, a neutralization reaction occurs and salt and water are formed:<br>
NaOH + HCl ->â†’ NaCl + H <sub>2</sub>O<br>
<li> The bases react with acidic or amphoteric oxides to form salts:<br>
2NaOH + SiO<sub>2</sub> -> Na <sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<br>
2NaOH + Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> -> 2NaAlO <sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<br>
<li> The bases enter into exchange reactions (react with solutions of salts):<br>
Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> -> 2NaOH + BaSO<sub>4</sub>
</ul>
