<h3> Common Properties </h3>
All amphoteric hydroxides are solids. Insoluble in water, mainly are weak electrolytes.<br>
<h3> Chemical properties of the property </h3>
Upon heating, they decompose to form the corresponding amphoteric oxide, for example:<br>
<ul>
Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub> -> FeO + H <sub>2</sub>O (at 150-200 degrees Celsius)<br>
In some cases, the intermediate product during decomposition is metahydroksid, for example:<br>

Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> -> AlO(OH) + H<sub>2</sub>O<br>
2AlO(OH) -> Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + H <sub>2</sub>O (at> 575 degrees Celsius)<br>
When interacting with acids, they form salts with an amphoteric element in the cation, for example:<br>
Zn (OH)<sub>2</sub> + 2HCl -> ZnCl <sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O<br>
If, instead of acid, an excess of alkali is added to the amphoteric hydroxide precipitate, it also dissolves, which does not occur with other hydroxides.<br>
This phenomenon is explained by the fact that in the presence of an excess of a strong base, zinc hydroxide is capable of giving off hydrogen atoms, like an acid:<br>
Zn (OH) <sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH = Na<sub>2</sub>ZnO<sub>2</sub> +2H<sub>2</sub>O<br>
This property of hydroxides is called amphotericity.<br>

Amphoteric are called hydroxides, which are capable of giving in reactions with other compounds both hydrogen atoms (ions) and hydroxy groups (hydroxyl anions).<br>
</ul> <br>
<h3> Getting </h3>
A common method for the preparation of amphoteric hydroxides is the precipitation of an appropriate amphoteric element diluted with alkali from the salt solutions, for example:<br>

ZnSO <sub>4</sub> + 2NaOH -> Zn (OH)<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub><br>

<h3> Examples of amphoteric hydroxides </h3>
Amphoteric include the following hydroxides:<br>
<ul>
<li> Most of the hydroxides of d-elements (chromium (III) hydroxide, iron (III) hydroxide, copper (II) hydroxide, zinc hydroxide, cadmium, etc.);
<li> A series of hydroxides of p-elements (aluminum, gallium, tin, lead, etc.);
<li> Of the hydroxides of the s-elements amphoteric is beryllium hydroxide; formally amphoteric hydroxides can be referred to water.
</ul>
