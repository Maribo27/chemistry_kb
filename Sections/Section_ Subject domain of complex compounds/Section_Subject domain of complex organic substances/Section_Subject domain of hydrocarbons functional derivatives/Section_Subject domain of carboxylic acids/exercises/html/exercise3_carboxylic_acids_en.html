	In the three test tubes without numbers are <sc_element sys_idtf="formic_acid">formic</sc_element>, <sc_element sys_idtf="acetic_acid">acetic</sc_element> and <sc_element sys_idtf="hydrochloric_acid">hydrochloric acids</sc_element>. Describe how, based on the differences in their physical and chemical properties, determine in which test tube which <sc_element sys_idtf="acid">acid</sc_element> is located.
