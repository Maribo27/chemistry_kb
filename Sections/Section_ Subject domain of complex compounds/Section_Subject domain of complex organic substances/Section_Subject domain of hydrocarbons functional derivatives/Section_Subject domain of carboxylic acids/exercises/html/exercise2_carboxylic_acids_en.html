    <sc_element sys_idtf="rrel_gram">250 g</sc_element> of limestone containing 20% ​​ <sc_element sys_idtf="impurity">impurities</sc_element> were dissolved in acetic acid, and <sc_element sys_idtf="nrel_amount">33.6 l</sc_element> of <sc_element sys_idtf="carbon_dioxide">carbon dioxide</sc_element> were obtained. What volume fraction is the yield of <sc_element sys_idtf="carbon_dioxide">carbon dioxide</sc_element> from the theoretically possible?
