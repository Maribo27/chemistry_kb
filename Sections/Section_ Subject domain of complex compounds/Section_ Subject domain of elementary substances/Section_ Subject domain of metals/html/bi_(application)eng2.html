Bismuth is used in semiconductor materials, used, in particular, in thermoelectric devices. Such materials include telluride (thermal emf of bismuth telluride 280 Î¼V / K) and bismuth selenide. A highly effective material based on bismuth-cesium-tellurium for the production of semiconductor refrigerators of superprocessors was obtained.
