<br> A characteristic feature of nonmetals is the greater (in comparison with metals) number of electrons at the external energy level of their atoms. This determines their greater ability to attach additional electrons, and the manifestation of a higher oxidative activity than that of metals.




<h3> Physical properties and structure of non-metals </h3>
Properties of non-metallic simple substances are very diverse. Strictly speaking, they are united only by the fact that they, as a rule, do not possess those physical properties that are typical for metals, i.e. do not have a characteristic metallic luster, ductility, ductility, high thermal and electrical conductivity.
<br> Aggregate state: under normal conditions, can be gaseous, liquid and solid substances.
<br> Color and shine: only some non-metals have a shine. For example, crystalline iodine, silicon and graphite do not look like the rest of the nonmetals - they have a gloss somewhat resembling the gloss of metals.
<br> Smell: peculiar to some non-metals. For example, a sharp suffocating odor has ozone, fluorine (when it hits the respiratory organs it almost immediately destroys the tissues), chlorine, bromine and iodine.
<br> Plasticity: only non-metals in a solid aggregate state are brittle.
<br> Electrical and thermal conductivity: nonmetals, with the exception of graphite, conduct heat poorly and practically do not conduct electric current (they are dielectrics).
<br> <br> The reason for the great variety of physical properties of nonmetals lies in the different structure of the crystal lattices of these substances.
 <br> Part of nonmetals has an atomic crystal lattice. Crystals of such substances consist of atoms, connected together by strong covalent bonds. Such nonmetals are in a solid aggregate state and are non-volatile. Examples of such substances are diamond, graphite, red phosphorus and silicon.
 <br> Another part of nonmetals has a molecular crystal lattice. In this case, in each molecule, the atoms are connected by a sufficiently strong covalent bond, but individual molecules are very weakly bound to each other in the crystals of the substance. Therefore, substances of molecular structure under normal conditions can be gases, liquids or low-melting solids.
 <br> Oxygen, ozone, nitrogen, hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, white phosphorus P<sub>4</sub>, crystalline sulfur S<sub>8</sub> and inert gases are all substances, crystals of which consist of individual molecules (and in the case of inert gases - from individual atoms acting as molecules).
 <br> <br> Of the 118 known at the moment chemical elements, 22 elements form simple substances that have nonmetallic properties. Nonmetallic simple substances are much larger than the nonmetallic chemical elements themselves. The reason for this is the existence of a phenomenon called <sc_element sys_idtf ="allotropy"> allotropy </sc_element>.


<h3> Chemical properties </h3>
In chemical reactions, non-metals can manifest themselves both as reducing agents and as oxidants. Of the general chemical properties of nonmetals, we note their ability to interact with metals, with hydrogen and oxygen.
<br> <br>
In reactions with metals, nonmetals manifest themselves as oxidants.
<ul>
<li> Halogens interact particularly with metals. As a result of the reactions of the compound, halide salts are formed.
<br> 2Al + 3I<sub>2</sub> → 2AlI<sub>3</sub>
<br> 2Fe + 3Cl<sub>2</sub> → 2FeCl<sub>3</sub> (with heating)
</li>
<li>
Metals react with sulfur, forming sulphides.
<br> 2Al + 3S → Al<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> (when heated)
<br> 2Na + S → Na<sub>2</sub>S
</li>
</ul>
<br> <br>
In reactions with hydrogen, volatile hydrogen compounds are formed whose composition of molecules corresponds to the general formula RH<sub>x</sub>, where R is a nonmetal and x is an index indicating the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule of the substance formed. This index numerically coincides with the valence of the nonmetal with which hydrogen is joined.
<br> H<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> → 2HCl (when heated)
<br> N<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub> → 2NH<sub>3</sub> (with heating and pressure)
<br> <br>
As a result of the combination of oxygen with other non-metals, oxides are formed.
<br> S + O<sub>2</sub> → SO<sub>2</sub>
<br> 4P + 5O<sub>2</sub> → 2P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>
<br> N<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2NO (when heated)

<h3> Finding in nature </h3>
Of the 118 chemical elements known at the moment, 96 are metallic and only 22 chemical elements are nonmetallic.
<br> Nonmetallic chemical elements are widely distributed in the earth's crust.
<br> Oxygen and silicon make up about 76% (almost three quarters) of the earth's crust (O<sub>2</sub> - 49.4%, Si - 25.8%).
<br> Chemical elements such as carbon C, hydrogen H, oxygen O, nitrogen N, phosphorus P, and sulfur S constitute 98.5% of the plant mass and 97.6% of the body weight of the human body.
<br> In volume fractions of nitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>, 78% are accounted for, oxygen - 21%, and inert gases are 0.96% of air volume. The composition of the terrestrial atmosphere also constantly includes carbon dioxide CO<sub>2</sub>, whose fraction is about 0.04% of the composition of clean air. Also in the air, water vapor H<sub>2</sub>O and other nonmetallic compounds are constantly kept in the air, the proportion of which is not constant.
<br> The main chemical element of the universe is hydrogen. From it formed the Sun and other stars, gas clouds, etc. And on our planet out of every 100 atoms, 17 are hydrogen atoms.


<h3> Application of non-metals </h3>
Since the properties of nonmetals are extremely diverse, these substances find wide application in various branches of the national economy.

<li> Industry:
Nonmetals such as sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorine are used as raw materials for the production of acids and other products.
<br> Sulfur is used as raw material in the production of rubbers.
<br> Soot is a pigment in the production of varnishes and paints, as well as a pigment and filler in the production of plastics and rubbers </li>
<li> Transport:
Hydrogen is used as fuel. It is important that the product of combustion of this fuel does not pollute the environment. </li>
