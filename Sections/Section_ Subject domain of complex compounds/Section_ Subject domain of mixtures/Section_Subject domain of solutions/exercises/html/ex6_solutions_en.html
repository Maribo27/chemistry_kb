23.70 g of substance A, consisting of 3 elements, were dissolved in concentrated nitric acid, while the evolved gases were again passed through the same solution. An excess barium chloride solution was added to the resulting solution. This produces 34.95 g of a white precipitate. Determine the substance A and write the equations of all conducted reactions.
