As a result of the partial decomposition of H2O2 in the solution, the mass of the solution decreased by 10% and a 32.5% solution of hydrogen peroxide was formed. Calculate the mass fraction of H2O2 in the initial solution and calculate how much of the H2O2 has decomposed (neglect evaporation of water).
