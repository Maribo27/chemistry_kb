A mixture of hydrogen and ammonia was passed through a heated tube with an excess of copper (II) oxide weighing 107.33 g. The volume of the collected gas after the tube was 5.6 l (n). The contents of the tube were mixed and divided into 2 equal parts. The first part was heated in an oxygen atmosphere and its mass increased by 6.8 g. The second part was completely dissolved in 2 liters of 20% nitric acid (density 1.19 g / cm3). Find the composition of the initial gas mixture in percent by volume and the mass fraction of copper nitrate in the resulting solution.
