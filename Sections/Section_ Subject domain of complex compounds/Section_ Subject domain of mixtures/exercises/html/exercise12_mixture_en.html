	The mixture consisting of hydrogen sulphide and oxygen is in a closed vessel at a temperature of 200 ° C and a pressure slightly below atmospheric. The mixture was heated and waited until the end of the reaction, after which the temperature was brought to the original. The pressure decreased by 28.6% compared with the original. Then 80 g of oxygen was added to the vessel and heated again until the reaction was stopped, after which the temperature was returned to the original (200 ° C). The pressure in the vessel was 1.43 times higher than the original. Determine the composition of the initial mixture in volume fractions, if it is known that there is still oxygen in the final mixture.
