32.05 g of a zinc alloy with a metal in a series of stresses after hydrogen were treated with excess dilute sulfuric acid. In this case, 4.48 liters of gas (NU) was released. Hot concentrated sulfuric acid was added to the undissolved residue until it was completely dissolved. In this case, 6.72 liters of gas were released. Determine the composition of the alloy, if it is known that the metal cation is bivalent.
